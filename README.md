This project was developed after hackaton model, in the day i was working for my job like employes, and night i was coded at this project, that code was wrote in hurry to work but contains some brilliant ideas and research, it's a prototype this is reason for which it's not the most clean code.

I was annoyed by limitation of a open source library for generation PDF, but this could be replaced by generation of HTML for print like Google Docs.

I was dissapointed too that i don't have knowledge to implement some feature like in Google Docs. Maybe i will find a utility at this project in the future.
